## Description

A fitness instructor records a trainee and shares workouts online in real time. There are online viewers who want to do the same workouts.
The process goes like this:
The fitness instructor has prepared two exercises - lie down and stand up, with which he periodically instructs the trainee.
The viewers watch the training participant and when he changes his position, they change theirs.
